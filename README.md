# Game2D
## What is this?
This is a submission to the [GameDev.tv Community Jam](https://itch.io/jam/gamedevtv-community-jam) with the theme "Time".
## What is this based on?
I started to write my own little 2D engine a few weeks before the game jam started. The game is built with that engine. The engine uses a few other libraries:
* GLFW and GLAD for OpenGL
* FMOD for audio
* glm for math
* stb_image for loading image files
* freetype for loading True Type fonts. freetype introduces the following sub-dependencies:
  * bzip2
  * libpng
  * zlib
## How to start the game?
Either you compile it yourself using Visual Studio (I was using VS19) or you just start the file "Game2D/Game2D.exe".
